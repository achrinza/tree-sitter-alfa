# ALFA 1.0 Tree Sitter Grammar

> [!WARNING]
> This is an early, experimental project. Hence, expect it to be incomplete, unstable, and incorrect.

An ongoing attempt to formalise the Abbreviated Language for Authorization (ALFA) Version 1.0.

## Goals

- FLOSS-licensed
- Accurate, but lenient (i.e. no hardcoded values that aren't important to the actual syntax)
- Support syntax highlighting and code folding
